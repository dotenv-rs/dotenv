This library is meant to be used on development or testing environments in
which setting environment variables is not practical. It loads environment
variables from a `.env` file, if available, and mashes those with the actual
environment variables provided by the operative system.

Usage
----

The easiest and most common usage consists on calling `dotenv::dotenv` when the
application starts, which will load environment variables from a file named
`.env` in the current directory or any of its parents; after that, you can just call
the environment-related method you need as provided by `std::os`.

If you need finer control about the name of the file or its location, you can
use the `from_filename` and `from_path` methods provided by the crate.

`dotenv_codegen` provides the `dotenv!` macro, which
behaves identically to `env!`, but first tries to load a `.env` file at compile
time.

Examples
----

A `.env` file looks like this:

```sh
# a comment, will be ignored
REDIS_ADDRESS=localhost:6379
MEANING_OF_LIFE=42
```

You can optionally prefix each line with the word `export`, which will
conveniently allow you to source the whole file on your shell.

A sample project using Dotenv would look like this:

```rust
extern crate dotenv;

use dotenv::dotenv;
use std::env;

fn main() {
    dotenv().ok();

    for (key, value) in env::vars() {
        println!("{}: {}", key, value);
    }
}
```

Variable substitution
----

It's possible to reuse variables in the `.env` file using `$VARIABLE` syntax.
The syntax and rules are similar to bash ones, here's the example:


```sh

VAR=one
VAR_2=two

# Non-existing values are replaced with an empty string
RESULT=$NOPE #value: '' (empty string)

# All the letters after $ symbol are treated as the variable name to replace
RESULT=$VAR #value: 'one'

# Double quotes do not affect the substitution
RESULT="$VAR" #value: 'one'

# Different syntax, same result 
RESULT=${VAR} #value: 'one'

# Curly braces are useful in cases when we need to use a variable with non-alphanumeric name
RESULT=$VAR_2 #value: 'one_2' since $ with no curly braces stops after first non-alphanumeric symbol 
RESULT=${VAR_2} #value: 'two'

# The replacement can be escaped with either single quotes or a backslash:
RESULT='$VAR' #value: '$VAR'
RESULT=\$VAR #value: '$VAR'

# Environment variables are used in the substutution and always override the local variables
RESULT=$PATH #value: the contents of the $PATH environment variable
PATH="My local variable value"
RESULT=$PATH #value: the contents of the $PATH environment variable, even though the local variable is defined
```

Dotenv will parse the file, substituting the variables the way it's described in the comments.


Using the `dotenv!` macro
------------------------------------

Add `dotenv_codegen` to your dependencies, and add the following to the top of
your crate:

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate dotenv_codegen;
```

Then, in your crate you may retrieve a value like so:

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("{}", dotenv!("MEANING_OF_LIFE"));
}
```

You may also panic with a supplied error message if the variable does
not exist:

```rust
fn main() {
    dotenv!("A_MISSING_VARIABLE", "This is an error message!");
}
```

Or you can supply a default value if the variable does not exist:

```rust
fn main() {
    let meaning_of_life: &str = dotenv_or_default!(
        "A_MISSING_VARIABLE",
        "42"
    );
    println!("{}", meaning_of_life);
}
```
